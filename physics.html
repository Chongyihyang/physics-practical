                <h4>1) Unable to accurately judge the location to measure the
                    diameter d of the water surface, hence the diameter could be
                    larger or smaller than the true value. <br>
                    2) Measurement of diameter d using the venier calipers does
                    not account for thickness of container wall, hence
                    measurement is larger than the true value. <br>
                    3) Response time for thermometer is slower as it takes time
                    for the alcohol to expand in the bulb. Hence, temperature
                    recorded by thermometer θ does not reflect the actual
                    temperature in the water. <br>
                    4) Unable to take simultaneous readings of temperature θ at
                    the exact time of 2 minutes. The temperature could have
                    changed as we switch from reading one instrument to
                    another. <br>
                    5) The cup and bowl is made of paper and changes shape
                    easily. Hence the diameter d of the water surface is not
                    uniform during measurement.
                </h4>
                <h4>
                    1) Use a transparent container so that the location can be
                    more accurately judged. <br>
                    OR <br>
                    Use containers of constant cross-sectional surface area so
                    that the diameter can be measured with the inner-jaws of the
                    vernier caliper at the top of the container. <br>
                    2) Measure the thickness of the container with a micrometer
                    screw gauge and subtract that from the diameter
                    measurement. <br>
                    3) Use a temperature sensor connected to a datalogger to
                    measure the temperature of water. <br>
                    4) Take a video of the setup when the reading is taken,
                    ensuring the stopwatch and thermometer can both be seen
                    in the video. Read off the temperature at the 2 minute mark
                    from the video. <br>
                    5) Use a rigid material for the cup and bowl like styrofoam or
                    plastic. <br>
